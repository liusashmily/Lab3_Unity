Five step coding for the beginner

Step 1: Tool Description
- Description: We are creating a script that will animate a 2d sprite sheet
- Functionally, we'll have control of the speed for the animation, the frames, placement,
- Tool side: Accessibe through the inspector
- Support for the diffuse, spec and the normal maps
- Tile sheet support for the level editing
- Support for individual charcter peices
- Any other ideas


Step 2: Research
- List of topics
- 2d sprite textures
- 2d array
- x, y coordinators
- u, v coordinators
- speed maybe fps
- offsetting to move u, v
- Time
- variable and their type
- Function 
- Materials and different types or maps
- Words that we don't know

Step 3: Instruction Manual
1. take a texture assign to a material
2. assign the material to a plane (gameObject)
3. assign our script to our plane and that will provide the options in the inspector
4. input the size of the spritesHEET, width and height
5, input the start frame location (row and column)
6. input the length of the animation
7. input the speed for the animation


Step 4: Pseudocode

Step 5: Write it already
